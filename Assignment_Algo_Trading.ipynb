        "\n",
        " * Before implementing the technical indicators, you are required to read and understand the indicators from the attached resource file provided along with this assignment.\n",
        "\n",
        " * To compute and plot technical indicators, you must first obtain historical market data now .For this purpose, use the yfinance library in Python. You may choose any stock of your choice (for example, Reliance, TCS, HDFC Bank, Infosys, etc.) and download its historical data for either the past 3 months or the past 6 months.\n",
        "\n",
        " * Code the indicator in python and  store the output in a new column. eg:- For RSI --> RS1_14 column.\n",
        "\n",
        " * For each indicator, clearly explain the parameters used (such as lookback period, smoothing period, signal period, or any other relevant parameter). You must justify why these values were chosen and explain how changing each parameter affects the behavior of the indicator.<br>\n",
        " You have to check out the results by playing with the default parameters of\n",
        " the indicators to identify which parameters give out the best results.\n",
        "\n",
        " * Each indicator must have one plot. You may plot it with price or separately, depending on what explains it best. <br>\n",
        "The purpose of plotting indicators in this question is to visualize and understand their behaviour with respect to market movements. At this stage, you are not required to form a trading strategy. You should plot indicators in a way that best explains what the indicator measures. Some indicators are best visualized along with price, while others are better understood when plotted separately.\n",
